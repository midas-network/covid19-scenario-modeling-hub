methods: "For each state our scenario projections are generated using an age/risk stratified SEIRS mechanistic model with vaccination. The model is calibrated to 2024-25 hospitalization and mortality data, and extrapolated through the 2024-25 season."
methods_long: >
    The model is an SEIRS compartmental model with four age groups: 0-17, 18-64 low-risk,
    18-64 high-risk, and 65+.  The susceptible population is divided into four compartments:
    Vaccinated, Vaccinated-waned, Infected-waned, and basic Susceptible.  The Recovered state
    assumes 100% protection for a short time.  In addition to standard waning, all susceptible 
    and recovered states bleed back 
    to basic Susceptible through immune escape at a rate of 30% per year.
    We use the population and vaccine time series provided by the Scenario Hub and
    assume that protection against infection accounts for 7/9ths
    of vaccine effectiveness against severe disease. The model is calibrated to 2024-25 season adult
    and pediatric COVID hospital admissions and all-age mortality. Due to the low coverage in 
    NHSN data for summer 2024, we substitute a proxy based on emergency room data.  The proxy data
    is used only for weeks where the NHSN data has low reporting, and is given a lower weight
    in the optimization objective function.
    The observed dual seasonality of COVID is
    accounted for using a flexible time-dependent transmission term. 
    Calibration parameters align closely to scenario D. 
    Additionally, calibration includes a preference for periodic/quasi-periodic trajectories. 
    Calibration is a two-stage process.  The first stage uses a traditional optimizer to find a
    centroid for the hyper-cube used in the second stage. In addition to normal optimization 
    parameters (Beta(t), I(0), S(0), etc), the first stage optimizes vaccine effectiveness 
    parameters.  Because the population starts with mixed levels of susceptibility, the VE 
    parameters require tuning for the model to exhibit the expected VE of 45%.
    National trajectories are calculated as
    the sum of states using semi-randomly ordered state level trajectories.  This ordering 
    essentially assumes some coherence in timing across the summed state trajectories.

data_inputs: >
    Pediatric and adult hospital admissions (both as-reported by NHSN, and a proxy based on ED data), 
    all-age mortality (NCHS). Proxy hospitalization data was obtained from the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak 
    Analytics (CFA), Scenario Modeling Group, by private communication.  All other data sources are
    publicly available.
