# Model Metadata file structure

This folder contains metadata files for each team-models 
submitting to the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. 

Each model is required to have metadata in 
[yaml format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html), 
e.g. [see this example metadata file](./team2-modelb.yaml).

----

## Subdirectory

Each sub-directory within the [model-metadata/](./) directory has the
format:

    team-model
    
where 

- `team` is the abbraviated teamname (`team_abbr`) and 
- `model` is the abbreviated name of your model (`model_abbr`). 

Both team and model should be less than 15 characters, and not include
hyphens nor spaces.

The `team-model` should correspond to the `team-model` sub-directory in the
associated model-output folder containing the associated projections.
