## Summary of results
FILL

## Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions
FILL

## Model assumptions: please describe:
### Number/type of immune classes considered
FILL

### Initial distribution of susceptibility (if available)
FILL (if available)

### Initial variant characteristics (transmissibility of variants at t=0, and how uncertainty or non-identifiability was handled)
FILL

### Details about calibration of immunity at t=0 (calibration period considered, assumptions about/fitting of past immune escape and waning immunity, is the same calibration process used for all scenarios?)
FILL

### Details about modeling of immune escape after t=0 (including what is the level of immune escape considered, whether a stepwise or continuous escape was considered and how immune escape affects infection- and vaccine-induced immunity)
FILL

### Assumptions regarding waning immunity against infection and symptoms (including values used for the duration and level of protection against infection or symptomatic disease, whether a point estimate was used or a range, and distribution used)
FILL

### Assumptions regarding waning immunity against severe disease (including whether immunity against severe disease, conditional on infection, is fixed vs declines over time; and if it wanes, specify how)
FILL

### Assumptions regarding boosting effect from multiple infections
FILL

### Is vaccination assumed to prevent infection and/or transmissibility?
FILL

### Describe the process used to set or calibrate disease severity, ie P(hosp given current infection) and P(death given current infection) details. What are the datasets used for calibration of the death targets?
FILL

### Describe seasonality implementation, e.g., whether seasonality varies by geography, what is the function used to model seasonal forcing, and which datasets are used to fit seasonal parameters
FILL

### What is the calibration period used to fit the model? How is the period of low reporting in hospitalization data in May-Nov 2024 handled?
FILL

### Details about modeling of age-specific outcomes, including assumptions on age-specific parameters (e.g., susceptibility, infection hospitalization risk or fatality risk, VE)
FILL

### Details about modeling of high-risk individuals, e.g., susceptibility and infection hospitalization risk or infection fatality risk, VE
FILL

### Is empirical data on human mobility or contact patterns used in the model?
FILL

### Is there a background level of non pharmaceutical interventions?
FILL

### Is importation from other countries considered?
FILL

### Other updates in model assumptions from previous rounds (e.g., demographic dynamics, immune escape, severity)
